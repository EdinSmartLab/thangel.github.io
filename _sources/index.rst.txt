I am a *Lecturer* in Water Engineering at the **University of Edinburgh**, incorporated within the School of Engineering and specifically the Institute for Infrastructure and the Environment. I am also an Industrial Innovation  *Research Fellow* of the UK's Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). My primary research interests relate to coastal & offshore engineering, environmental fluid mechanics and water research.

Prior to Edinburgh, I was a Research Fellow  with the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at **Imperial College London** (2016-2018). 
The post was based in the Applied Modelling & Computation Group (AMCG) conducting research on ocean modelling and marine energy technologies. 

I was also based at the Hydro-environmental Research Centre of **Cardiff University** (2014-2016) conducting research on multi-purpose marine energy technologies once completing my studies for a PhD in Hydro-environmental Engineering (2014) and an MEng(Hons) in Civil Engineering (2010). 
Details of my academic trajectory are summarised in my `CV <_themes/personal/static/CV_2.pdf>`_.
