    - `Lucas Mackie <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.mackie18>`_ presented a `poster <https://www.dropbox.com/s/uqv1dbsawfqiynu/OTE_Poster_A1.pdf?dl=0>`_ on his doctoral research progress on  the optimisation of  tidal  range power plant operation. It was presented at the University of Oxford's `Tidal Energy Workshop <https://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/events/7th-oxford-tidal-energy-workshop/>`_ where the latest research developments in the field are annually discussed.

    - A short publication has is now available on the assessment of tidal range structure operations at *Dams and Reservoirs*, the journal of ICE's British Dam Society. It highlights that operation optimisation using simplified models is mostly accurate for small schemes, as the larger impact on tidal dynamics is difficult to parameterise for schemes of a larger scale. The paper can be accessed `from here <https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/jdare.18.00042?journalCode=jdare>`_.

    - A new paper has been published in *Applied Energy* on the MSc research study of Freddie Harcourt on the `flexibility of tidal range power plant operation <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.12.091>`_. It presents recent insights on how this inherent flexibility on generation times could be used to negotiate more attractive subsidy deals.

    - I presented research `updates <http://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_full.asp?pcode=NE/R013209/1&cookieConsent=A>`_ and an overview of tidal engineering research challenges at the `Energy Futures Lab <http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/administration/energyfutureslab/eventssummary/event_7-9-2018-10-21-39>`_ on 15/11/18. A blog post regarding the theme of the talk can be found `here <https://energyfutureslab.wordpress.com/2018/11/15/tidal-lagoon-barrage-power-plants-in-the-uk-operation-assessment-and-optimisation/>`_.

    - Research together with colleagues from Imperial College was presented at the biennial Conference on Renewable Energies Offshore in Lisbon (RENEW 2018). `Zoe Goss <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/z.goss15>`_ presented her `progress <http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BjhyDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA255&dq=info:8FNPRGtYPSkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=a7_8_hMhBw&sig=uBDRPNE1Rq8Gj2VZHTQBYygOB90>`_ on tidal stream energy in Alderney race and I gave a talk on the feasibility and characteristics of `twin-basin lagoons <http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BjhyDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA159&dq=info:IuP6Re4rgQUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=a7_8_hMiyu&sig=Myj9sPWKoXrArxcjPTXqmkyw8AU>`_.

    - Following two uniquely rewarding years at Imperial College with the Department of Earth Science and Engineering, I have joined the School of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh as a Lecturer in Water Engineering within the `Institute for Infrastructure and Environment <https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/iie>`_.

    - Exceedingly pleased by the acceptance of our paper on tidal lagoon vortices with `Carolanne Vouriot <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/fluid-mechanics/people/carolanne-vouriot/>`_, `Stephan Kramer <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.kramer>`_ and `Matt Piggott <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.d.piggott>`_. The paper is open access funded by NERC and EPSRC and is accessible at `Environmental Fluid Mechanics <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10652-018-9626-4>`_.
