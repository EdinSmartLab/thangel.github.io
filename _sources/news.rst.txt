News & Updates
==============

*November, 2018*

- I presented research `updates <http://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_full.asp?pcode=NE/R013209/1&cookieConsent=A>`_ and an overview of tidal engineering research challenges at the `Energy Futures Lab <http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/administration/energyfutureslab/eventssummary/event_7-9-2018-10-21-39>`_ on 15/11/18. A blog post regarding the theme of the talk can be found `here <https://energyfutureslab.wordpress.com/2018/11/15/tidal-lagoon-barrage-power-plants-in-the-uk-operation-assessment-and-optimisation/>`_.

*October, 2018*

- Research together with colleagues from Imperial College was presented at the biennial Conference on Renewable Energies Offshore in Lisbon (RENEW 2018). `Zoe Goss <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/z.goss15>`_ presented her `progress <http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BjhyDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA255&dq=info:8FNPRGtYPSkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=a7_8_hMhBw&sig=uBDRPNE1Rq8Gj2VZHTQBYygOB90>`_ on tidal stream energy in Alderney race and I gave a talk on the feasibility and characteristics of `twin-basin lagoons <http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BjhyDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA159&dq=info:IuP6Re4rgQUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=a7_8_hMiyu&sig=Myj9sPWKoXrArxcjPTXqmkyw8AU>`_.

- Following two uniquely rewarding years at Imperial College with the Department of Earth Science and Engineering, I have joined the School of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh as a Lecturer in Water Engineering within the `Institute for Infrastructure and Environment <https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/iie>`_.

*September, 2018*

- Exceedingly pleased by the acceptance of our paper on tidal lagoon vortices with `Carolanne Vouriot <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/fluid-mechanics/people/carolanne-vouriot/>`_, `Stephan Kramer <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.kramer>`_ and `Matt Piggott <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.d.piggott>`_. The paper is open access funded by NERC and EPSRC and is accessible at `Environmental Fluid Mechanics <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10652-018-9626-4>`_.
