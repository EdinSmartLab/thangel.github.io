abstract = {The regular and predictable nature of the tide makes the generation of electricity with a tidal lagoon or barrage an attractive form of renewable energy, yet storm surges affect the total water-level. Here we present the first assessment of the potential impact of storm surges on tidal-range power. Water-level data (2000–2012) at nine UK tide gauges, where tidal-range energy is suitable for development (e.g. Bristol Channel), was used to predict power. Storm surge affected annual resource estimates −5{\%} to +3{\%}, due to inter-annual variability, which is lower than other sources of uncertainty (e.g. lagoon design); therefore, annual resource estimation from astronomical tides alone appears sufficient. However, instantaneous power output was often significantly affected (Normalised Root Mean Squared Error: 3{\%}–8{\%}, Scatter Index: 15{\%}–41{\%}) and so a storm surge prediction system may be required for any future electricity generation scenario that includes large amounts of tidal-range generation. The storm surge influence to tidal-range power varied with the electricity generation strategy considered (flooding tide only, ebb-only or dual; both flood and ebb), but with some spatial and temporal variability. The flood-only strategy was most affected by storm surge, mostly likely because tide-surge interaction increases the chance of higher water-levels on the flooding tide.},

abstract = {The UK has some of the largest tidal ranges in the world with the potential for extensive renewable electricity generation. In the light of commitments to meet EU renewable energy targets, there is an emerging interest towards marine renewable energy schemes, seeking to harness the energy resource available from the high tidal ranges recorded around certain locations of the Welsh coastline. This study examines the combined far-and near-field impacts of multiple coastally attached tidal lagoons proposed along the North Wales coast. A two-dimensional numerical model, based on an unstructured triangular mesh, has been refined to simulate the hydrodynamic processes for some of the proposed coastally attached impoundments (or tidal lagoons). A validated finite volume method has been implemented to solve the 2D shallow water equations, based on a second-order accurate spatial and temporal numerical scheme. Details are given of the significant hydro-environmental aspects which must be taken into account when optimizing the design of such proposals. The operation of the tidal lagoons has a considerable effect on the hydrodynamics in the region, including significantly mitigating against flood risk in areas which were previously susceptible to coastal flooding. In the meantime, predicted electricity generated by the lagoon turbines highlights the potential of this untapped energy resource around Wales.},

abstract = {This study considers environmental impacts and the power production potential of a number of coastally attached tidal lagoons, proposed along the North Wales coast, UK. Initially, the impoundment shape, turbine and sluice gate locations were modified according to the regional bathymetric data. A refined 0-Dimensional approach was implemented to optimise the lagoon operation, based on given turbine and sluice gate specifications. In turn, a two-dimensional numerical model, based on an unstructured triangular mesh, has been refined to simulate the hydrodynamic processes, initially without and subsequently in the presence of the lagoons. The hydrodynamic model adopts a TVD finite volume method to solve the 2D shallow water equations, based on a second-order accurate spatial and temporal numerical scheme. An encouraging performance is apparent in reproducing the established conditions encountered in the region through comparisons against available data. The incorporation of tidal lagoons in the model appears to have a considerable effect on the flow structure in the region, by inducing high velocity accelerations near the sluices and turbines, depending on the stage of the tidal cycle. Considering a two-way generation regime, it is outlined that the loss of intertidal regions can be minimised, which is a major source of concern with regards to the environmental impact of such schemes through an ebb-generation operation. Particular focus is directed towards the comparisons between the 0-D and 2-D modelling results, an aspect which has not been reported previously. Predictions of the models diverge as the scale of the lagoon project increases, but it is highlighted that the 0-D methodology can be utilised for the optimisation of the processes in the initial stages of design before proceeding to more sophisticated numerical model simulations.},

Particular focus is directed towards the formulations imposed for the representation of hydraulic structures and the corresponding model boundary conditions. Details of refinements are presented that would be applicable in representing the flow (and momentum flux) expected through tidal range turbines to inform the regional modelling of tidal lagoons and barrages. A conceptual tidal lagoon along the North Wales coast, a barrage across the Severn Estuary and the Swansea Bay Lagoon proposal are used to demonstrate the effect of the refinements for projects of a different scale. The hydrodynamic model results indicate that boundary refinements, particularly in the form of accurate momentum conservation, have a noticeable influence on near-field conditions and can be critical when assessing the environmental impact arising from the schemes. Finally, it is shown that these models can be used to guide and improve tidal impoundment proposals.},

abstract = {The hydrodynamics and mixing processes in small- and full-scale baffled disinfection tanks are studied experimentally and numerically. Velocity and tracer transport measurements are carried out to quantify the hydrodynamics and to obtain reliable data used to validate a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The flow in the tank under investigation is extensively three-dimensional due to the existing inlet condition of the tank, resulting in short-circuiting and internal recirculation, particularly in the first three compartments. Near the inlet the tracer residence time distribution curve analysis and Hydraulic Efficiency Indicators (HEIs) suggest poor disinfection performance. Further away from the inlet, the flow recovers to a two-dimensional flow and the HEIs improve until the exit of the tank. The computational results demonstrate good agreement between the predicted hydrodynamics and tracer transport with the corresponding experimental data. The numerical model is then employed to investigate the effects of up-scaling of laboratory model findings to a full-scale contact tank. Despite the Froude-Reynolds conflict the full-scale contact tank exhibits similar behaviour to the small-scale tank. The effect of the tank geometry on the disinfection efficiency is demonstrated, highlighting the negative impact of flow three-dimensionality on pathogen inactivation.},

abstract = {In this study three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, incorporating appropriately selected kinetic models, were developed to simulate the processes of chlorine decay, pathogen inactivation and the formation of potentially carcinogenic by-products in disinfection contact tanks (CTs). Currently, the performance of CT facilities largely relies on Hydraulic Efficiency Indicators (HEIs), extracted from experimentally derived Residence Time Distribution (RTD) curves. This approach has more recently been aided with the application of CFD models, which can be calibrated to predict accurately RTDs, enabling the assessment of disinfection facilities prior to their construction. However, as long as it depends on HEIs, the CT design process does not directly take into consideration the disinfection biochemistry which needs to be optimized. The main objective of this study is to address this issue by refining the modelling practices to simulate some reactive processes of interest, while acknowledging the uneven contact time stemming from the RTD curves. Initially, the hydraulic performances of seven CT design variations were reviewed through available experimental and computational data. In turn, the same design configurations were tested using numerical modelling techniques, featuring kinetic models that enable the quantification of disinfection operational parameters. Results highlight that the optimization of the hydrodynamic conditions facilitates a more uniform disinfectant contact time, which correspond to greater levels of pathogen inactivation and a more controlled by-product accumulation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Results are presented herein of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study of flow, transport processes and bacteria inactivation in contact tanks. Three-dimensional numerical simulations are conducted using a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equation approach. In a first step the CFD model is validated using data from a previously undertaken laboratory experimental study from which velocity and conservative tracer transport data were available for comparison. The good agreement between CFD and experimental data confirm that the model accurately reproduced the hydrodynamics and tracer transport processes. The analysis of the results yielded that the flow in the tank was extensively three-dimensionality which was attributed to the current inlet configuration. Hydraulic efficiency indicators and bacteria inactivation simulations confirmed that such a flow had a negative impact on the disinfection performance. The potential for tank optimization was examined via additional simulations, featuring varying inlet designs and a superior baffling configuration. The optimization approaches implemented remarkably enhanced the performance of the model, indicating a greater bacteria inactivation level for the same disinfectant dosage. Keywords},

abstract = {In this study three-dimensional numerical models were refined to predict reactive processes in disinfection contact tanks (CTs). The methodology departs from the traditional performance assessment of contact tanks via hydraulic efficiency indicators, as it simulates directly transport and decay of the disinfectant, inactivation of pathogens and accumulation of by-products. The method is applied to study the effects of inlet and compartment design on contact tank performance, with special emphasis on turbulent mixing and minimisation of internal recirculation and short-circuiting. In contrast to the conventional approach of maximising the length-to-width ratio, the proposed design changes are aimed at addressing and mitigating adverse hydrodynamic structures, which have historically led to poor hydraulic efficiency in many existing contact tanks. The results suggest that water treatment facilities can benefit from in-depth analyses of the flow and kinetic processes through computational fluid dynamics, resulting in up to 38 {\{}{\%}{\}} more efficient pathogen inactivation and 14 \& less disinfection by-product formation.},

ABSTRACT = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has consolidated as a tool to provide understanding and quantitative information regarding many complex environmental flows. The accuracy and reliability of CFD modelling results oftentimes come under scrutiny because of issues in the implementation of and input data for those simulations. Regarding the input data, if an approach based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations is applied, the turbulent scalar fluxes are generally estimated by assuming the standard gradient diffusion hypothesis (SGDH), which requires the definition of the turbulent Schmidt number, Sct (the ratio of momentum diffusivity to mass diffusivity in the turbulent flow). However, no universally-accepted values of this parameter have been established or, more importantly, methodologies for its computation have been provided. This paper firstly presents a review of previous studies about Sct in environmental flows, involving both water and air systems. Secondly, three case studies are presented where the key role of a correct parameterization of the turbulent Schmidt number is pointed out. These include: (1) transverse mixing in a shallow water flow; (2) tracer transport in a contact tank; and (3) sediment transport in suspension. An overall picture on the use of the Schmidt number in CFD emerges from the paper.},

A numerical modelling methodology that evaluates their effects on the hydro-environment has been refined to consider technical constraints and specifications associated with variable turbine designs and operational sequences. The method has been employed to assess a number of proposals and their combinations within the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary in the UK. Operational challenges associated with tidal range power plants are highlighted, while also presenting the capabilities of modelling tools tailored to their assessment. Results indicate that as the project scale increases so does its relative hydrodynamic impact, which may compromise annual energy output expectations if not accounted for. However, the manner in which such projects are operated can also have a significant impact on changing the local hydro-environment, including the ecology and morphology. Therefore, it is imperative that tidal range power plants are designed in such a way that efficiently taps into renewable energy sources, with minimal interference to the regional hydro-environment through their operation.},

The simulations are validated successfully in terms of hydrodynamics and tracer transport with experimental velocity data and measured residence time distribution curves confirming the accuracy of the method. The hydrodynamics are characterised by flow separation and subsequent recirculation in vertical and horizontal directions and the solute dispersion process is a direct response to the significant unsteadiness and turbulence in the flow. The turbulence in the system is analysed and quantified in terms of power density spectra and covariance of velocity fluctuations. The injection of an instantaneous passive tracer and its dispersion through the system is simulated. Large-eddy simulations enable the resolution of the instantaneous flow field and it is demonstrated that the instabilities of intermittent large-scale structures play a distinguished role in the solute transport. The advection and diffusion of the scalar is governed by the severe unsteadiness of the flow and this is visualised and quantified. The analysis of the scalar mass transport budget quantifies the mechanisms controlling the turbulent mixing and reveals that the mass flux is dominated by advection.",

abstract="The generation and evolution of tidally-induced vortices in coastal and estuarine regions can influence water quality and sedimentary processes. These effects must be taken into consideration in the development of coastal reservoirs, barrages and lagoons, among other environmental flow applications. Results are presented here on the fate of large-scale vortices within confined tidally-forced domains. A computational approach is employed using the Thetis depth-averaged coastal ocean modeling framework. Initially, two test cases serve to demonstrate model capability in capturing the formation of dipoles downstream of oscillatory flow channels. Diagnostic quantities of vorticity and localized circulation are used to track the 2-D vortex evolution and dissipation. This approach is then applied to tidal lagoon geometries, where flows through the inlet induce a pair of counter rotating vortices (dipoles). Idealized model geometries and inlet conditions are used to determine the impact of three design parameters on large-scale vortical structures: (a) the lagoon geometry aspect ratio in the horizontal plane, (b) the inlet width and (c) the bathymetry profile as the coastline is approached. The dependence of vortex flushing behavior on the dimensionless ratio {\$}{\$}{\{}{\}}^{\{}W{\_}{\backslash}text{\{}i{\}}{\}}{\backslash}!/{\_}{\{}UT{\}}{\$}{\$}Wi/UT(where {\$}{\$}W{\_}{\backslash}text{\{}i{\}}{\$}{\$}Wiis the width of the inlet channel, U is the maximum velocity and T is the tidal period) is reaffirmed, while the side walls and the sloping bathymetry are found to affect the vortex dissipation process.",
